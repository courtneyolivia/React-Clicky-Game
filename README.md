<h1><b>Clicky Game</b></h1>


<h2><b>Overview</b></h2>

React-clicky-game is a simple memory game created using React. This project required me to break up the UI into components, manage component state, and respond to user events.


<h2><b>Instructions</b></h2>

<ol>
<li>This application renders different iPeppa Pig images to the screen. Each image listens for click events.</li><br/>
<li>It keeps track of the players score. The players score is incremented when clicking an image for the first time.</li><br/>
<li>The user's score is reset to 0 if the player clicks the same image more than once.</li><br/>
<li>Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page shuffle themselves into a random order.</li><br/>
  <li>Once the players score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game restarts.</li><br/>
</ol>
